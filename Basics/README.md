# nRF52840 Zephyr Training Examples
This repository contains small example projects for the nRF52840 DK using the Zephyr RTOS.  
I use these examples for learning purposes as I am new to Zephyr development.  
Many of the examples are based on or inspired by Nordic Semiconductor's official samples and training materials.

## Examples

| Example | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **blinky** | Simple LED blinking example. |
| **button_led_polling** | LED controlled by a button using polling. |
| **button_led_interrupt** | LED controlled by a button using GPIO interrupts. |
| **die_temperature** | Reads the nRF52840 internal die temperature sensor. |

## Requirements

- nRF52840 DK (PCA10056)  
- nRF Connect SDK (NCS) v2.x or newer  
- Visual Studio Code with nRF Connect for VS Code extension
